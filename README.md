# Mindiser Quiz App

Mindiser Quiz app is a Biafra quiz inspired by the novel "There was a country". A novel written by Chinua Achebe. “There Was a Country…” actually means what it says. It is neither a prefatory statement nor folkloric rhetoric. There was indeed a country that embodied the aspirations of a people, who in unison, did all they could to preserve it, but lost it due to factors beyond their control.

In addition Mindiser is a quiz app that wants to put in the mind of users the present state of Biafra as Biafrans contiunes in their quest for freedom.

The app demonstrate how pure JavaScript works in a real-world context. The site will be targeted toward people who not only love to implement more advanced JavaScript concepts but also to people who love history. The site is a fully responsive JavaScript game that will allow users to read a question and give them option to choose their answer.
